# Versions

## Current

The current version of the SICP is written against LFE 2.0-dev; as such, it has started tracking its own version in sync with LFE releases.

## Previous

After the LFE 2.0 release, you will see a link to content created as part of that effort here. At which point the "Current" version will be incremented.
